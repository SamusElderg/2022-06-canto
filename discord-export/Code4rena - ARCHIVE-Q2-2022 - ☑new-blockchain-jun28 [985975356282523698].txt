Hi all it's very nice to meet you. Excited to hear your thoughts and answer your questions regarding our project! This is our first time using C4 so if you have any suggestions on improving documentation/organization we would love to hear them.

I'd love to know as much as possible about the new design of your blockchain, and not just because it will help with auditing. It just sounds interesting in general!


[06/14/2022 9:18 PM] 100proof
For instance, what do you mean by free liquidity? Probably that means no fees, but any other connotations?


[06/14/2022 9:20 PM] 100proof
And how is free liquidity connected to the notion of a new blockchain? Isn't it an independent concept? i.e. what stops someone making a smart contract that swaps tokens for no fees on an existing chain?

[06/14/2022 9:20 PM] 100proof
I'm sure I'm asking silly questions. Just asking because the details are a bit thin in the contest documentation


[06/15/2022 1:09 AM] scott_lew_is
@100proof free =  zero LP fees, zero rake on the lending protocol

core defi primitives on “new blockchain” are free public infrastructure. dexes as we know them on ethereum are sorta like greyhound buses. privately transporting folks to make a proft. core dexes on “new blockchain” are more like a public subway system (with free tickets). liquidity is paid for by the layer 1 protocol and offered free to all traders, users and other protocols.

[06/15/2022 1:11 AM] scott_lew_is
nothing would stop people from deploying a no fee dex on another chain, just liked nothing would stop me from building a public subway system in nashville. just im not sure why i would do that.

{Reactions}
😅 😂 

[06/15/2022 3:00 AM] chicagoguy#9197
@100proof Adding on to what Scott said, this public infrastructure is paid for by incentives in the form of wrapped native tokens provided using the flywheel mechanism (reservoir and comptroller contracts) in the lending market


[06/15/2022 4:23 AM] 100proof
This is all very good information. Thanks!


[06/15/2022 6:05 AM] 100proof
@chicagoguy  I'd like to know more about the Rent Extraction Resistance property you want to have for New Blockchain. In practice, how do you enforce this? When the Internet first started it was this wonderful place full of open protocols but over time things got built on top of those open protocols that people came to depend on, and the rents are just extracted from that. I mean IRC was a pretty good chat program - completely open standards - but are we using it still? And there are a "million" different chat applications - WhatsApp, Signal, Telegram, etc. with very little interoperability. The problem of rent extraction - or even just interop/compatibility - is a very hard one to solve I think.

Anyone else?


[06/15/2022 4:01 PM] scott_lew_is
@100proof ill explain more on this later. tbh, it is kinda out of scope for the c4 contest. the tl;dr is that vertical monopolies that run from onchain primitive to user facing interface are anti-competitive (just like how  Standard Oil controlled oil drilling, oil transport and retail gas stations before US antitrust movement made laws that allowed it to be broken up)


[06/15/2022 4:02 PM] scott_lew_is
but by making the low level primitive Free Public Infrastructure and not developing a canonical swapping interface it is (in my opinion) implausible that vertical monopolies will emerge like we have seen elsewhere.

I am getting an error when doing a yarn install on ZeroSwap root. Any idea what this is about? @chicagoguy @ampingle

[06/16/2022 1:45 AM] t_k___
@abhinavmir / evmsecurity.org hmmm not sure why that's occurring. Have you tried pulling each submodule individually? Technically, there is no reason you need to pull all of them at once. We just did that so we could push changes in a modular way

edit: cloning* not pulling


[06/16/2022 1:46 AM] t_k___
I would also recommend cloning the modules individually instead of through the main repo. Seems that some people are having issues with that. Will try to figure out ASAP.

I'm a bit confused, without ends the review of the previous one, how will start the next one? There are QA and gas issues without any review in github


[06/24/2022 10:39 PM] 0x1f8b
It will be a different code?


[06/26/2022 2:11 PM] JohnSmith#1623
Do I need to read everything about first contest or new contest is not related much to the old one?


[06/26/2022 2:12 PM] JohnSmith#1623
Reading thousands lines of code from first contest just for this 3 day contest will not be fun.


[06/26/2022 2:36 PM] cryptphi
each contest has a scope....guess you'd have to wait till the new contest start before getting the scope.

There seems to be a small typo on the contest page.

```
git --recurse-submodules "https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-06-NewBlockchain-v2.git"

yes yes but still unable to clone "lending-market-v2" submodule


[06/28/2022 8:44 PM] cryptphi
that's weird, worked easily for me. can you try it in a different directory?


[06/28/2022 8:48 PM] cryptphi
For this new contest, what actually is the scope? Because right now I'm looking at bunch of files which feels like I'm repeating the whole process I went through in the previous contest


[06/28/2022 8:50 PM] cryptphi
looks like I'm re-iterating what John posted few days ago


[06/28/2022 9:06 PM] chicagoguy#9197
@cryptphi So the scope is technically all of the code that is specified in the contest scope section. This is a cleanup audit for the prior codebase which we fixed up after the initial audit.


[06/29/2022 2:40 AM] chomtana
Can you provide diff


[06/29/2022 3:51 AM] hellocccz
I wonder if issues that were confirmed but not fixed in v1 will be considered ?


[06/29/2022 3:59 AM] 100proof
I just read through the README and added up the SLOC of all the in-scope contracts. It came to 3074 SLOC. Am I reading this correct? That seems very high for a 3-day $25K contest.


[06/29/2022 4:08 AM] chomtana
This mean certified plus can just copy and paste these issues if it can be considered


[06/29/2022 4:47 AM] hellocccz
Yes, so I don't think these should be considered


[06/29/2022 4:48 AM] hellocccz
But just to avoid fomo, I want to make sure


[06/29/2022 5:42 AM] thepicodes
I guess if they are not fixed it means they didn't consider them valid ? Weird though, they didn't wait for judging to go for a second audit


[06/29/2022 6:04 AM] thepicodes
Wouldn't it be wiser to only do this contest after the first one is judged ? Unless the sponsor is in a rush

[06/29/2022 10:31 AM] road220
guys, do you think that for gas reports it's important to include only smth within the scope or we can write down some suggestions for other parts as well?
I mean, it's a bit strange to optimize only half of project...


[06/29/2022 10:33 AM] JohnSmith#1623
generally, you can do whatever you want, but your work will be compensated only within scope


[06/29/2022 10:35 AM] road220
that's completely fair for bug findings and etc, but for gas optimizations - idk...


[06/29/2022 10:57 AM] illilli000
it's a lot more work for judges to filter out out of scope findings. If you really think you should include them, they should be clearly marked as out of scope for the judge

{Reactions}
💯 thankyou 

[06/30/2022 7:08 PM] chicagoguy#9197
No they are not being considered as we fixed all issues that we believed were valid before submitting for this clean up audit


[06/30/2022 7:09 PM] chicagoguy#9197
We are still working with the judges to award all the findings currently


[06/30/2022 7:10 PM] chicagoguy#9197
Agreed it isn't ideal to launch another audit so soon after but we are in a bit of a rush

[08/31/2022 8:11 PM] hake_stake
Does this amount include both USDC + $CANTO or is it just the USDC part?

I totally bumped on v2 , all my findings were invalid 😅

{Reactions}
hi5 

[09/01/2022 8:38 PM] alextheentreprenerd
I commented the issues if you want to check the reasoning behind why I closed them as invalid

I comment almost all findings, even the ones I close as invalid


[09/01/2022 8:38 PM] alextheentreprenerd
Maybe need to wait until report though, not sure


[09/01/2022 9:33 PM] cryptphi
Thanks, yeah I did see the comments. Just wasn't my week that period. ...was really a pleasant contest 👍🏾

[09/03/2022 10:08 AM] utocif
Could you please send the link where you comment the issues please?


[09/03/2022 10:11 AM] utocif
I would like to see why mine was rejected :p


[09/03/2022 2:40 PM] alextheentreprenerd
Because you don't have backstage you will have to wait until the report is out, prob a month of so, will check and send you a note with my comment

Note that all findings for all contests are made public when the report is published, just go on the Github for the contest


[09/03/2022 2:40 PM] rohan16
Even my qa report was rejected but I guess due the way I reported it was not up to the mark I felt


[09/03/2022 2:52 PM] alextheentreprenerd
Sent notes to both


[09/03/2022 3:25 PM] Noah3o6#2496
Where can you see if you findings were invalid?


[09/03/2022 3:27 PM] alextheentreprenerd
The Github Repo with all reports is made public once the report is published, if you have backstage tag you can see the reports earlier

need $CANTO rewards - need to mint my longnecks 😭

nvm I bridged and minted one already 😊

**Important - re: award coin**

Wardens: we made an error in how we listed the awards for this contest; it was supposed to be $12.5k USDC + $12.5k worth of Canto. Since we made an error, we'll give everyone 7 days to tell us if you want your award in USDC only.

**If you prefer to be paid in USDC only, **please leave a comment in this thread to request that. ****

**If you do not comment in this thread by September 15, 2022 1:00 PM, **we will send your awards as 50/50 USDC/Canto.****
